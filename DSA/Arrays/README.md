### ‚úÖ Solved Problems

#### 1. [Intersection of Two Arrays](./IntersectionOfTwoArrays.java)
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Approach**: Two-pointer technique
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m) where n and m are array lengths
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, m)) for storing result
- **Problem**: Find common elements between two sorted arrays
- **Example**: 
  ```
  Input: nums = [2,3,5,7,8,10], arr = [3,4,6,9,10]
  Output: [3, 10]
  ```
